## Simulation results  
The simulated DNA replication prifiles are organized in the following folders:
* `runA_ran`: first simulation run - model variant 1 - random origin positioning
* `runA_spb`: first simulation run - model variant 2 - realistic origin positioning
* `runA_uni`: first simulation run - model variant 3 - SPB-mediated particle activation
* `runB`: second simulation run - model variant 3 - SPB-mediated particle activation

Each folder contains a number of `.csv` files, where DNA replication completion times and origin firing times are recorded. The simulation parameters are indicated in the filename, where `N` the number of particles, `D` the diffusion coefficient, `R` the attraction radius, `P` the binding probability and `A` the activation probability.
