# Example animations of DNA replication model

The SPB-mediated variant was simulated for a randomly selected genome structure. 

Dots correspond to origins, with the dot color indicating firing time (red: early firing, green: late firing). Passively replicated origins are not shown for simplicity.

Lines correspond to the three fission yeast chromosomes: Chromosome 1 - red, Chromosome 2 - green, Chromosome 3 - blue.

Simulation parameters were set as follows: N = 150 particles, r<sub>attr</sub>=0.025 μm, D=0.5 μm<sup>2</sup>/s,  P<sub>bind</sub>=1, P<sub>act</sub>=1
